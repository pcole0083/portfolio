  title: About Me
  description: >
    I am currently the Principal Frontend Developer @ Pixafy LLC. I solve client issues using
    React, Redux, Node, GraphQL, and SASS. I really enjoy what I do and love to learn new things
    every day. But what I enjoy most is working with passionate teams and helping teach, inspire,
    and learn from other devs.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.
