  title: About Me
  description: >
    I am currently the Principal Frontend Developer @ Pixafy LLC. I solve client
    issues using React, Redux, Node, GraphQL, and SASS. I really enjoy what I do
    and love to learn new things every day. But what I enjoy most is working
    with passionate teams and helping train, teach, and learn from other devs.
