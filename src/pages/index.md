    I am currently the Principal Frontend Developer @ Pixafy LLC. I solve client
    issues using React, Redux, Node, GraphQL, and SASS. I really enjoy what I do
    and love to learn new things every day. But what I enjoy most is working
    with passionate teams and helping train, teach, and learn from other devs.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
